CS116 PROJECT

  In our project, we aimed to simulate how a smart power grid would manage energy unsafe across different appliances and locations. At its current stage, our program can loop through multiple time intervals, determine which appliances are "on" based on their probability values, and calculate the total power unsafe. For smart appliances, the simulation reduces their power usage based on the specified reduction percentage. This part of the system is functioning as expected and required, it gives a clear picture of how energy is consumed under normal conditions.
  We implemented a basic method for handling situations when total power unsafe exceeds the defined warning level. Currently, our approach is functional but not very efficient. Instead of selectively cycling off smart appliances in a way that minimizes disruption, the system does not prioritize based on wattage or importance. All "on" smart appliances are treated equally, which does not always lead to optimal load reduction. In some cases, the system falls back on randomly reducing power across locations, simulating brownouts in a blunt, less strategic way.
  This method technically prevents the system from crashing under overload, but it does not reflect how a smart grid would intelligently respond in the real world. A more effective solution would involve sorting or ranking smart appliances based on their wattage and turning off the least essential or most power hungry ones first. If that still does not resolve the overload, then entire locations could be shut down, but only as a last-ditch effort.
